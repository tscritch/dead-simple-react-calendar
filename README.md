# Dead Simple React Calendar
[View in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dead-simple-react-calendar-5l3fg)

### Why?
Because I figured it couldn't be that hard to make a calendar and I needed a fun challenge. This is a no frills base to work from. It is meant to be copied into your project _not_ installed. Replace the bloated calendar you are using with this and all your headaches will magically disappear. (Stress will literally take days off your life)

### How you can use DSRC?
However you want! Add a time selection component, add animations, add multi/range select, make a cool gravestone calendar to be displayed on your dream gravestone!

### Installation
No.

### License
Distributed under the MIT License. See LICENSE for more information.

### Contributions
If you have a sugguestions or want to improve the code in any way go ahead and submit a PR. But I will say I won't be looking to add much.
