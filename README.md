# Dead Simple React Calendar
[View in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dead-simple-react-calendar-5l3fg)

### Why?
This is a no frills base to work from. It is meant to be copied into your project _not_ installed. Replace the bloated calendar you are using with this and all your headaches will magically disappear.

### How you can use DSRC?
However you want! Add a time selection component, add animations, add multi/range select, make a wicked gravestone calendar to be displayed on your dream gravestone!

Copy the `calendar.tsx` and `utils.ts` for all the functionality.
If you want the styling you see in the sandbox copy the `styles.css` file as well.

### Installation
